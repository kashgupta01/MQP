This project consists of an Investigation of Large Language Models in Generating Accurate Identification of Molecular Machines Across Model Organisms. 
It is part of the Major Qualifying Project undertaken by me and my teammate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

Objective: 
Molecular machines, protein complexes in particular, play a key role in the everyday
functions of all living organisms. Despite the significance of molecular machines, information about their composition remains scattered across articles and databases, and
each database is reliant on experimental methods for validation for their data. However,
with the ever-growing popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models have been
proposed as a potential method in order to compile information about protein complexes
into a singular dataset for widespread scientific use. By using models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity, implementing prompt engineering techniques, and optimizing the
workflow, we aim to formulate a pipeline to generate protein composition of the
queried proteins.
